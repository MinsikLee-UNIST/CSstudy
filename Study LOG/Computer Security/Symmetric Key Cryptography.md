## Symmetric Key Cryptography
- The same key is used to encrypt/decrypt messages
	- Also known as secret key algorithm

- Pros
	- Fast
	- Intuitive
- Cons
	- Once the key is compromised, then the whole system becomes useless
	- Key sharing is difficult
	- Digital sign is difficult

### Requirements in Symmetric Encryption
- A strong encryption algorithm
	- Assume encryption algorithm is known
- The secrecy of the key
	- A secret key known only to sender/receiver
	- Must be unpredictable
