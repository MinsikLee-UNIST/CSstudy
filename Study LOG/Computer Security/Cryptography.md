## Cryptography
- Cryptography is about confidentiality and Integrity (+ Authentication, Non-repudiation)
- "Secret writing" in Greek
- Goal : protect your sensitive messages/data from eavesdropping
- The most basic building block of computer security
- Kerckhoff's Principle
	> You should always assume that the adversary knows the encryption/decryption algorithm!

> "The art of writing or solving codes (Oxford English Dictionary)"
- Codes
	- For secret communications: confidentiality
	- Modern cryptography includes more: integrity, non-repudiation, secret key exchange, etc.
- Art
	- Little theory but ad-hoc designs
	- Modern cryptography:: science and math
