## Block Cipher Modes of Operation

- Determine how to repeatedly apply a single-block operation to a sequence of blocks? 
	- => Modes of operation!
- Different modes of operations
	- ECB : Electronic Code Book
		- Each block is encoded independently of the other blocks
		- Advantages
			- Simple and efficient(i.e. parallelizable) to compute
			- The error does not have any effects on the other blocks
		- Disadvantages
			- Same plaintext always corresponds to same ciphertext
	- CBC : Cipher Block Chaining
		- Each previous cipher block is chain with current plaintext block
		- Advantages
			- Does not reveal any patterns the plaintext may have
		- Disadvantages
			- Cannot parallelize encryption
				- (How about the decryption process?)
			- An error affects one other block
				- (Toggles only one bit in the next block)
	- CFB : Cipher FeedBack
		- Each previous cipher block is feedback for the next stage
		- Advantages
			- Does not reveal any patterns the plaintext may have
			- Does not use a decryption algorithm
				- (The implementation is efficient)
		- Disadvantages
			- Cannot parallelize encryption
				- (How about the decryption process?)
			- An error affects one other block
	- OFB : Output FeedBack
		- Each encrypt output is feed back for next stage
		- Advantages
			- Does not reveal any patterns the plaintext may have
			- Does not use a decryption algorithm
				- (Use the same structure for both encryption and decryption)
			- An error has no effect on other blocks
				- Error of one bit in ciphertext affects only one bit in the plaintext block
		- Disadvantages
			- Cannot parallelize encryption and decryption
				- However, we can overcome this advantage by preparing encyption/decryption in advance
					- Boost Up OFB Mode
	- CTR : CounTeR mode
		- Encrypt counter value rather than any feedback value
		- Advantages
			- Does not reveal any patterns the plaintext may have
			- Can do parallel encyption/decryption in H/W or S/W
				- can preprocess in advance of need
			- Does not use a decryption algorithm
				- Use the same structure for both encryption and decryption
			- An error has no effect on other blocks
				- Error of one bit in ciphertext affects only one bit in the plaintext block
		- Disadvantages
			- Must ensure never reuse key/counter values, otherwise could break
